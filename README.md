# Neural-Network-from-Scratch-NumPy-

This project implements a simple feedforward neural network from scratch using only NumPy, without relying on deep learning frameworks.

🔍 What’s Included

Forward propagation

Binary Cross-Entropy loss

Backpropagation using chain rule

Gradient Descent optimization

ReLU & Sigmoid activation functions

🏗️ Network Architecture
Input Layer → Hidden Layer (ReLU) → Output Layer (Sigmoid)

🎯 Goal

To understand how neural networks actually learn by manually implementing every step involved in training.

🚀 Why This Matters

Building a neural network from scratch removes the black box behind deep learning frameworks and strengthens core ML & DL fundamentals.

🧪 Tools Used

Python

NumPy

📌 Next Step

Extending this implementation using PyTorch and scaling it to deeper networks.
